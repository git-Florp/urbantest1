# Welcome to the Urbanshade OS (website)!

(do fullscreen and shi-: `urbanshade.lovable.app`)

## Why is this on Lovable?

Bcuz my plan for this project was that:
I create the base
Lovable does more advanced stuff and gives me idas
(mostly bcuz i suck with coming up with ideas)

## Is this paid or smth?

Hell no
I do this bcuz its fun and i dont get bored.
I wanna both improve my programming
Also, i was bored :P

## Can i copy this?

Second, ofcourse. I dont mind.
Heck ur not obligated to credit me
Do what you want with this
My only thing that matters is that i have fun :D
