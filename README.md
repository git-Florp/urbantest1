## Can I copy this?

Short answer: Yes — with respect.

Please follow these guidelines before using or redistributing any part of this project:

- Attribution: Do not claim the project (or major parts of it) as your own. Include a visible attribution line in your fork or derivative work. Example:
  - "Based on Urbanshade by aswdBatch — https://github.com/aswdBatch/urbanshade-7e993958"
- Redistribution: Do not redistribute the project verbatim as your own project. If you redistribute, clearly state what you changed and keep a link back to the original repository.
- Modifications: You are welcome to modify the code. When you do, document the changes (what, why, and who made them) in a changelog or in commit messages.
- Commercial use: If you plan to use this in a commercial product or for large-scale distribution, please contact the maintainer first to discuss licensing and attribution.
- No explicit license yet: This repository currently does not include a formal license file. Copyright is retained by the author. If you want clearer permissions, request that a license (for example MIT or Apache-2.0) be added.
- Contributing back: If you improve something, please consider opening a pull request so improvements can benefit everyone.

If you’d like, I can add an explicit LICENSE file (MIT suggested) and commit it as well — tell me if you want that.

## Reporting problems and giving suggestions

We value your feedback! To keep things organized, please open a single GitHub issue for each distinct bug or suggestion. Use the format below to make issues easy to triage and act on.

Issue template (paste into a new issue):

**Type:** Bug / Suggestion / Question

**Description**
- A short description of the problem or suggestion.

**Steps to reproduce (for bugs)**
1. Step one
2. Step two
