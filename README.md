Hell no

## Can I copy this?

Short answer: Yes — with respect.

Please follow these guidelines before using or redistributing any part of this project:

- Attribution: Do not claim the project (or major parts of it) as your own. Include a visible attribution line in your fork or derivative work. Example:
  - "Based on Urbanshade by aswdBatch — https://github.com/aswdBatch/urbanshade-7e993958"
- Redistribution: Do not redistribute the project verbatim as your own project. If you redistribute, clearly state what you changed and keep a link back to the original repository.
- Modifications: You are welcome to modify the code. When you do, document the changes (what, why, and who made them) in a changelog or in commit messages.
- Commercial use: If you plan to use this in a commercial product or for large-scale distribution, please contact the maintainer first to discuss licensing and attribution.
- No explicit license yet: This repository currently does not include a formal license file. Copyright is retained by the author. If you want clearer permissions, request that a license (for example MIT or Apache-2.0) be added.
- Contributing back: If you improve something, please consider opening a pull request so improvements can benefit everyone.

If you’d like, I can add an explicit LICENSE file (MIT suggested) and commit it as well — tell me if you want that.

## Reporting CRITICAL Errors

**This section is only for compiling errors. For other bugs, please use the standard feedback template.**

Steps before reporting
1. Make sure you have all dependencies installed:  
   `
   npm install
   `
2. If the error still persists:  
   - Take a screenshot of the error.  
   - Copy both the command you ran (npm run build) and the full error output.  
   - Send them to emailbot00noreply@gmail.com using the template below.  

---

Email Template

Subject: [Your Name] – Critical Compile Error  

Body:  
`
Command: npm run build
Error Output: [paste full error here]

Screenshot: [attach screenshot file]

Environment:
- OS: [Windows / macOS / Linux / Android]
- Node.js version: [e.g. v18.17.0]
- npm version: [e.g. 9.6.7]
- Device: [Laptop / Phone / etc.]
`

---

Notes
- Only use this process for compile-time errors (build fails, dependency issues, etc.).  
- For runtime bugs, UI glitches, or feature suggestions, please use the standard GitHub issue template.  
- The more detail you provide (error logs, environment info, screenshots), the faster the issue can be diagnosed

  Again, this is ONLY meant for COMPILER ERRORS, and you have to be using a supported nodejs version.
